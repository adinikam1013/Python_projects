# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

A simple command-line number guessing game built using Python. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the user tries to guess it in as few attempts as possible.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The game picks a random number between 1 and 100.
- You enter your guesses one by one.
- The game gives you feedback: "Too low", "Too high", or "Correct!".
- It tracks how many attempts you make to guess correctly.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3 (already installed in GitHub Codespace)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in your GitHub Codespace.
2. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python3 number_guessing_game.py

Follow the on-screen instructions.

🖼️ Example

🎯 Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 50
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess: 30
Too low! Try again.
Enter your guess: 40
🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
